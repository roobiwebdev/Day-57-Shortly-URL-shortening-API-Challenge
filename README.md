#Day57 of #100DaysChallenge

Good evening, guys!

I’m back after a brief hiatus of >8 days .. and this time i’m gonna be committed to pushing through and posting daily. I know I didn’t keep my last promise but I’m here now and ready to get back on track. There's a lot to catch up on, and I'm excited to dive into more projects to realign with my goals.

Today's project is a URL shortener—simple yet functional. Here's what I worked on:

✅ Creating a clean, minimalistic landing page for URL shortening 

✅ Utilizing the TinyURL API for shortening links 

✅ Adding functionality to copy the shortened URL directly

It feels amazing to be back on the grind after a bit of inconsistency. Let's keep up the momentum and make the most of the days ahead!

Let's Work and never forget to...⚡️
